# React-blog-app
Welcome to my simple react app! This repository is for the front end React code. For server code, please navigate to caoyr03/node-blog-server.

## Getting Started
To connect to the server locally, you need to set up a proxy that allows for cross-region resource sharing. 
```
npm install -g local-cors-proxy
lcp --proxyUrl https:localhost:5000
```
Open a new terminal, clone this project, in the top of directory, run `npm start`
